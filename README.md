[COVID-19 Test & Trace](https://covid-19-test-and.web.app/)

In order to open your business up to customers in the UK, you are required to submit customer details to the NHS track and trace system, in case someone tests positive to COVID-19, so they will know who came into contact with the positive testing individual.

This system allows smaller businesses, that do not have access to the bigger tracing system, to reach out to me and get themselves signed up. Customers entering the business will scan a QR code leading to the domain above and will be able to fill out their personal information.

Upon submitting, their details are stored securely in a Firebase Firestore, alongside the time they entered the business, this data can then be downloaded and sent off to the NHS system to keep track of each customer.
